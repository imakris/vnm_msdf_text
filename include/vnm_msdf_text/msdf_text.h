/**
 * @brief Per-codepoint layout data in scale-independent font units and atlas UVs.
 *
 * The baked atlas stores glyph geometry in the font's own coordinate units, not
 * in output pixels, so a single baked atlas can produce layout for many draw
 * pixel heights without rebuilding the bitmap. Convert a glyph to output pixels
 * for a given draw pixel height with scaled_glyph().
 *
 * bounds_*_units are the glyph outline bounds in font units (Y-up, as reported
 * by the shape). advance_units is the horizontal advance in font units. visible
 * is true when the glyph has a rasterized bitmap; advance-only glyphs such as
 * U+0020 are not visible and scale to a degenerate (zero-area) plane rectangle.
 *
 * UVs address atlas_t::rgba, where row 0 is the first row in memory and T
 * increases downward. UVs are determined by the bake and do not change with the
 * draw pixel height.
